## OPEN SOURCE HARDWARE from fibers to fabrics

None
### Learning outcomes

* References: tutorial , links, inspiration
* Design: sketch, 3D modeling skills, Parametric modeling skills
* Fabrication: Capable of executing from file to production workflow, from 3D modelling  to digital fabrication, parameters, materials
* Documentation: Anyone can go through the process and understand it
* Final outcome : Is the project assembled, functioning and complete
* Originality - Aesthetics: Has the design been thought through and elaborated

### Student checklist

* Research and document existing fabrication methods, machines and industries, add references and sketches of the machine and the chosen process
* Design and document the files of the machine, machine hack or tool and fabrication - assembly process
* Document the schematic and the software source code (if any)
* Document the parts and how to make your tool or machine
* Bill of materials: electronics, materials amount other (references of the components)
* Design, create and document a final outcome, a sample project of your process
* Make a small video of the machine
* Create an interface for controling your machine (extra credit)
