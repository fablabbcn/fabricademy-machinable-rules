### Learning outcomes

* Explore computational design methods towards a new reinterpretation of cloths, garments and accessories for fashion design, inspired by a new digital design methodology
* Learn how to use Grasshopper or similar software along with the relevant software libraries
* Understand how to develop or modify an existing parametric model with the goal of producing it using digital fabrication techniques

### Have you?

* Built a parametric model using Grasshopper3D or similar software
* Produced your model using 3D Printing or other digital fabrication technologies
* Experimented a combination of the techniques introduced in the class
* Create a sample of your 3D printed piece for the analog library

## FAQ

Q Is it mandatory to use Grasshopper3D
As this is one of the standard tools, that have created a large community of users and libraries around it, it is strongly recommended to try this software. But other parametric packages such as Autodesk Dynamo / Revit are acceptable.
