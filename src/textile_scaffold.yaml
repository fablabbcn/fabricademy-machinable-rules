tasks:
- name: The Textile Scaffold
  description: 
  outcomes:
  - Broaden the knowledge of technical textile applications and industrial processes. 
  - Learn to shape 3D forms with textiles and yarns.
  - Understand yarn and textile properties. 
  - Learn the processes, machines, materials & tools to create textile composites and casts.
  - Concrete fabric forming technique, 
  - Crystallization
  - Alternative Techniques
  checklist:
  - Used the method of concrete fabric forming to shape your fabric mold ( advanced: used 3D modeling software to simulate your fabric deformation, laser cut pattern of fabric)
  - Chose one Crystal and created a textile medium for the crystal growth
  - Create a 3D mold and a textile composite
  - Documented the process you followed
  - Documented errors and failures
  - Recorded the process in video or made a stop motion movie
