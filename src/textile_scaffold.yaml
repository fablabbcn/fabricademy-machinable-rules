    description:
    outcomes:
      - "References: tutorial, links, inspiration"
      - "Design: Sketch, 3D modeling skills, Parametric modeling skills"
      - "Fabrication: Capable of executing from file to production workflow, from 3D modelling to 3D printing, parameters, materials"
      - "Documentation: Anyone can go through the process and understand it"
      - "Final outcome: is the project assembled, functioning and complete"
      - "Originality - Aesthetics: Has the design been thought through and elaborated"
    checklist:
      - Document the concept, 3D model of the piece and document the design process
      - "Make two samples with 2 out of the 5 techniques to make a prototype of a textile form: fabric formwork with casting, crystalization, wood-textile, resin-textile, leather molding or other"
      - "Document the process from CAD to CAM, document how to use the CNC mill and prototype your textile composite"
      - "Upload your 3D model and CAM file"
      - "Document the 2 processes you have followed side by side from design to machine and hands-on making, materials you used, your mistakes, failures and achievements"
      - "Use 3D modeling software to simulate your fabric deformation (extra credit)"
